## 🤝 Gratitude and Thanks

This README redesign was inspired by several other homelab repos:

- [khuedoan/homelab](https://github.com/khuedoan/homelab)
- [onedr0p/home-ops](https://github.com/onedr0p/home-ops/)
- [zimmertr/TKS](https://github.com/zimmertr/TKS)

Without the inspiration and help of these folks, I don't think my own project would be nearly as far. Make sure to check out their projects as well!
