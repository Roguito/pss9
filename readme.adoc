= Dan Manners' Homelab

____
All of the readme's are in a state of flux at this moment.
I'm working on refactoring much of the repository, but I'm happy to answer any questions in the https://discord.gg/k8s-at-home[k8s@Home Discord server] or on Discord!
Feel free to reach me at `danmanners` with any questions or at link:mailto:daniel.a.manners@gmail.com[daniel.a.manners@gmail.com]!

Current status: *BETA* (but is highly stable)

This project aims to utilize industry-standard tooling and practices in order to both perform it's functions and act as a repository for people to reference for their own learning and work.

== Deployment Order of Operations

== Identifying Problems, Troubleshooting Steps, and more

Below are a few things that may be beneficial to you when troubleshooting or getting things up and operational

=== Traffic is not getting from the edge (cloud) nodes to the on-prem cluster networking

You can validate that your remote traffic is or isn't making it on site by using `dig` inside of the link:[netshoot container]

[,bash]
----
kubectl run temp-troubleshooting \
  --rm -it -n default \
  --overrides='{"apiVersion":"v1","spec":{"nodeSelector":{"kubernetes.io/hostname":"talos-aws-grav01"}}}' \
  --pod-running-timeout 3m \
  --image=docker.io/nicolaka/netshoot:latest \
  --command -- /bin/bash
----

Then, you can validate that you can reach CoreDNS or another pod/service IP from your remote node.

If you can prove it is not working, you may want to restart all of Cilium:

[,bash]
----
kubectl rollout restart -n kube-system daemonset cilium
----

== To-Do Items

* Ensure that *ALL* services are tagged for the appropriate hardware (`arm64` or `amd64`) to ensure runtime success
 ** Alternatively, ensure that all containers are built for multi-architecture.
* Ensure that *ALL* application and service subdirectories have READMEs explaining what they're doing and what someone else may need to modify for their own environment

== Gratitude and Thanks

This README redesign was inspired by several other homelab repos, individuals, and communities.

Without the inspiration and help of these individuals and communities, I don't think my own project would be nearly as far.
Make sure to check out their projects as well!
